# Task description
Develop a music management app for Android based on the LastFM API. With the help of the app the user should be able to search for artists, pick one of their top albums and save it locally.
The app should contain the following screens:
1. Main Screen:
- All locally stored albums are shown here.
- A tap on one of these albums opens a detail-page.
- These screens (Main and Detail) should work without having an
internet connection.
- It's possible to open the search screen from this view.
2. Search Page:
- On this page it should be possible to search for an artist on the
LastFMApi.
- Furthermore there should be a button next to a text field which
starts the search.
- The results of the search should be shown in a list.
- A selection of one list-item opens the albums-overview screen.
 3. Top
- The best albums of an artist are shown here.
- It should be possible to store (and delete stored) albums locally.
- Tap on an album opens the detail-page and at least the following
information should be stored: - Name
- Artist
- Image (doesnâ€™t matter in which size) - Tracks
